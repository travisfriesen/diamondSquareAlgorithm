# Diamond Square Algorithm

This algorithm was written for a COMP 2140 (Data Structures & Algorithms) bonus project.

I took the opportunity to attempt to write my own implementation of this algorithm using a little bit of help from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GuAV1PnurU) and the [Diamond Square Algorithm Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm), and once I got it working wanted to be able to display it nicer for my presentation. Using `sample_output.csv` and `blender_script.py` a blender script I got ChatGPT to generate it was able to render out the Algorithm to look like this: ![Smooth Terrain using the diamond square algorithm](https://github.com/travisfriesen/diamondSquareAlgorithm/blob/10de5b5ff436c4711de8c149645f30a820a24e9b/DSG.png)

I learned so much from trying to work out how this algorithm was implemented, and hope to get to do more like this in the future!
